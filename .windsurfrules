# MARKDOWN EDITOR PROJECT RULES

## CODE DISCIPLINE

- Make focused changes only related to current feature
- No refactoring unrelated code
- Use minimal changes to achieve functionality
- Keep components isolated and independent
- Document exceptions when modifying unrelated code

## TESTING

- Treat tests as immutable unless feature changes
- Write tests before implementing features
- Never reduce test coverage
- Investigate test failures thoroughly

## WORKFLOW

- Use `npm run dev` for development (prevents multiple servers)
- Rely on Vite's hot module replacement
- Use Prettier for formatting (not ESLint)
- Run tests and lint before committing

## EDITOR REQUIREMENTS

- Maintain dual-pane layout (markdown source + rich text)
- Ensure bidirectional syncing between panes
- Keep text left-aligned, not center-aligned
- Use compact UI elements and toolbar
- Support standard markdown formatting
- Implement custom directives for colors and buttons

## CURRENT STATUS

- Completed basic editor with dual-pane layout
- Implemented bidirectional syncing
- Created compact toolbar with formatting options
