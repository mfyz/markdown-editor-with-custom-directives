# Human Developer Estimate

These estimates are based on a single experienced full-stack developer working on the project, with regular review cycles. The estimates account for development time, testing, debugging, and review processes.

## Iteration Breakdowns

- **Iteration 1: Project Setup and Basic Editor (1-2 days)**

  - Project initialization typically takes 2-4 hours for an experienced developer
  - Setting up linting, VSCode configuration, and Git hooks requires 2-3 hours
  - Implementing a basic editor with minimal styling takes 4-8 hours
  - Potential challenges include configuring the editor base library and ensuring proper markdown rendering

- **Iteration 2: Testing Infrastructure (2-3 days)**

  - Setting up Jest configuration and initial test utilities takes 4-6 hours
  - Configuring React Testing Library and creating test fixtures requires 4-6 hours
  - Setting up Playwright and creating initial E2E tests takes 6-8 hours
  - Potential challenges include ensuring proper test isolation and setting up realistic test scenarios

- **Iteration 3: Standard Formatting Features (2-3 days)**

  - Implementing text styling features takes 4-6 hours
  - Creating link functionality with popovers requires 6-8 hours
  - Writing comprehensive tests for these features takes 6-8 hours
  - Potential challenges include handling complex user interactions and edge cases

- **Iteration 4: Editor Modes and Toolbar Options (2-3 days)**

  - Implementing different editor size variants takes 4-6 hours
  - Creating toolbar variants (fixed and floating) requires 6-8 hours
  - Testing different modes and responsive behavior takes 6-8 hours
  - Potential challenges include ensuring consistent behavior across different modes

- **Iteration 5: Integration and Demo Page (1-2 days)**

  - Finalizing the component API takes 3-4 hours
  - Creating a demo page with multiple instances requires 4-6 hours
  - Writing end-to-end tests for the demo page takes 3-4 hours
  - Potential challenges include ensuring consistent behavior across different configurations

- **Iteration 6: Custom Directives (3-4 days)**
  - Implementing the text color directive with color picker takes 8-12 hours
  - Creating the button directive requires 6-8 hours
  - Writing comprehensive tests for custom directives takes 8-12 hours
  - Potential challenges include parsing and rendering custom markdown syntax correctly

## Total Estimated Time

Total estimated time: 11-17 days

## Assumptions and Variables

These estimates assume:

- Regular feedback and review cycles
- No major architectural changes during development
- Familiarity with React and the chosen editor library
- Some time allocated for addressing unexpected issues

The actual time may vary based on:

- The complexity of edge cases encountered
- The learning curve for specific libraries
- The depth of testing required
- The number of review cycles and revisions needed
